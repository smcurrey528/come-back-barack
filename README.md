### Overview of Game

"Come Back Barack" is an interactive clickable video game where the player will click to gain points and avoid the obstacles in order to win. The objective is to energize Obama so he will  come back from vacation, but the user will need to catch "Liberal Snowflakes" to keep him energized. However, there are red "Make America Great Again" Hats that are obstacles and if the user clicks on the red hat then Obama goes back on vacation.

### Continued Challenges
One of the continued challenges I am having is that I wanted to remove the alerts and manipulate the DOM innerHTML and remove elements. However, I keep receiving an error stating that element.remove(); is not a function and it continues to run the game after the player has won or lost.
